Rack pull træner den øverste fase af dødløft. Stangen starter ved knæene i stedet for på gulvet.

**Fordele** ved rackpulls er, at de styrker ballemusklerne, baglårene, kropsstammen, øvre ryg og grebsstyrken. Rack pulls er særligt god til at opbygge musklerne i den øvre ryg.

- **Deadlift Substitute.** If your lower back keeps rounding on Deadlifts, you could do Rack Pulls while working on [hip mobility](http://stronglifts.com/7-dynamic-stretches-to-improve-your-hip-mobility/).
- **Overload.** Depending on the height at which you start and your sticky point, Rack Pull can let you hande heavier weights than Deadlifts.
- **Hip Power.** Correctly performed Rack Pulls start from a dead stop with little knee extension. This builds a strong, explosive [posterior chain](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-optimize-posterior-chain-power-glute-activation/).

**Rack Pull Starting Position.** Set the safety pins so the bar starts below your kneecaps. Get used to this height before trying different ones.

- **Foot Stance**. Shoulder-width stance with toes slightly out. Curl your toes up. Jump up a few times: that’s the stance for Rack Pulls.
- **Shins Vertical to The Floor.** Neglecting to do so involves your quads. Put your shins perpendicular to the floor when looking from the side.
- **Grip Width.** Too small & your hands touch your legs on the way up. Too wide & you have to pull the bar higher. Use about 51cm/20″ grip width.
- **Gripping the Bar.** Put the [bar close to your fingers](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-grip-bars-correctly-push-vs-pull-exercises/), not in the palm of your hands. This will minimize callus formation & torn skin.
- **Straight Arms.** Pulling with bent arms can tear your biceps muscles. Keep your arms straight. Tighten your triceps.
- **Bar Against Your Shins.** The closer the bar, the easier the lift. Put the bar against your shins, just below your kneecaps.
- **Shoulder-blades above The Bar.** When looking from the side: shoulders in front of the bar and [shoulder-blades above the bar](http://stronglifts.com/why-your-shoulder-blades-must-over-the-bar-on-deadlifts/).
- **Chest Up.** Shoulder blades back & down, chest up. Imagine someone puts a [pen between your shoulder-blades](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-bench-press-with-proper-technique-avoid-shoulder-injuries/#tight-upper-back) and you try to squeeze it.
- **Straight Neck.** [Safer for your cervical spine](http://stronglifts.com/where-to-look-during-squats/). Keep your neck inline with the rest of your spine.

**How to Perform Rack Pulls.** Once you’ve set up correctly, the Rack Pull is like a Deadlift: push the floor away from you until lockout.

- **Push Through the Floor.** Curl your toes up and push through the floor. Think of pushing the floor away from you.
- **Keep the Bar Close to You.** The closer, the safer & easier. Start with the bar against your shins. Roll it over your thighs until lockout.
- **Bring Your Hips Forward**. Push from the heels & [squeeze your glutes](http://stronglifts.com/why-you-should-always-squeeze-your-glutes/) hard. This prevents pulling with the lower back.
- **Lock Your Hips.** No need to roll your shoulders or hyper-extend your lower back. Rack Pulls end when your knees & hips are locked.

Lower the bar by pushing your hips back until the bar hits the safety pins.

**Common Mistakes on Rack Pulls.** The biggest mistake is the shoulder & shin position: bad positioning kills posterior chain emphasis.

- **Dropping Your Knees Forward.** Involves your quads instead of your hips. Put your knees perpendicular to the floor. Push your hips back.
- **Shoulders over The Bar.** Usually coupled with knees forward. Shoulders in front of the bar, [shoulder-blades above the bar](http://stronglifts.com/why-your-shoulder-blades-must-over-the-bar-on-deadlifts/).
- **Looking Forward.** Hyper-extending your neck increases risks of cervical spine injury. Keep your neck inline with the rest of your spine.
- **Bending Your Arms.** Can tear your biceps when pulling heavy weights. Pull with straight arms, tighten your triceps.
- **Bending Your Back.** Harder to do here compared to Deadlifts, but still possible. Big chest, shoulder-blades back & down, tight upper-back.
- **Hyper-extending at The Top.** Posteriorly stresses your lumbar discs. Lock your hips at the top, and come back, no need to hyper-extend.

Check the video below on how NOT to perform Rack Pulls. 3 errors: shoulders over the bar with knees dropped forward, hyper-extending the lower back at the top and hyper-extending the neck. Avoid all of these on Rack Pulls.
